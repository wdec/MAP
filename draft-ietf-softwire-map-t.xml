      <t>Experiences from initial IPv6 deployments indicate that transitioning
      a network providers&rsquo; domain fully to IPv6 requires not only the
      continued support of legacy IPv4 users connected to the boundary of that
      domain, allowing IPv4 address sharing, but also the need for carrying
      out IPv6-only operational practices in that domain [, also for traffic
      from IPv4 users. The use of an double NAT64 translation based solutions
      is an optimal way to address these requirements, particularly in
      combination with stateless translation techniques that seek to minimize
      challenges outlined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The Mapping of Address and Port - Translation (MAP-T) solution
      defined in this document is such a solution, that builds on existing
      stateless NAT64 techniques specified in <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>,
      along with a stateless algorithmic address &amp; port mapping scheme to
      allow the sharing of IPv4 addresses across an IPv6 network. The MAP-T
      solution is closely related to MAP-E <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"></xref>, with both utilizing the same
      algorithmic method, but differing in their choice of translation <xref
      target="RFC6145"></xref> and encapsulation <xref
      target="RFC2473"></xref>based IPv6 transports.</t>

      <t>A companion draft defines the DHCPv6 options for provisioning of MAP
      <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option"></xref>, applicable to
      both MAP-T and MAP-E.</t>

      <t>The MAP-T CE is responsible for connecting a users' private IPv4,
      along with any native IPv6 network to the IPv6-only MAP-T domain.</t>

      <t>The MAP-T BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
      all devices in one or more MAP-T domains, using stateless NAT64 as
      extended by the MAP-T rules in this document.</t>

      <t>Besides the CE and BR, the MAP-T domain can contain any regular
      IPv6-only hosts/servers that have an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address
      (IPv4-translatable address per <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>) using a
      prefix assigned to the MAP-T domain. Communication with such devices is
      naturally possible in the MAP-T architecture from inside or outside the
      MAP-T domain including from any IPv4-only hosts. In this mode, any
      IPv6-only servers SHOULD have both A and AAAA DNS server records. DNS64
      <xref target="RFC6147"></xref> becomes required only when IPv6 servers
      in the MAP-T domain are expected themselves to initiate communication to
      internal/external IPv4-only entities.</t>

      <t>Functionally the MAP-T CE and BR use existing standard functional
      building blocks, or extensions to these as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>A standard NAPT <xref target="RFC2663"></xref> function on a MAP
          CE is extended with support for restricting the allowable TCP/UDP
          ports for a given IPv4 address. The enforcement of NAPT function, as
          well as the port restriction is conditional upon the MAP CE's
          configuration as applied by the network operator.</t>

          <t>A standard stateless NAT64 function <xref target="RFC6145">
          </xref>is extended for translating IPv4 traffic to IPv6, based on a
          lookup of source/destination IPv4 address + TCP/UDP port or ICMP id
          information that is then mapped to the source/destination IPv6
          address. This algorithmic mapping is specified in section 5.</t>
        </list>Section 6 describes how these functional blocks are combined
      with the Mapping Rules of Section 4 to enable IPv4-IPv6 communication
      between the CE and BR and IPv6-only servers in the domain.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Mapping Rules">
      <t>A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.</t>

      <t>Mapping rules are used differently depending on their function. Every
      MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic mapping rule. This is used by
      the node to configure its IPv4 address, IPv4 prefix or shared IPv4
      address. This same basic rule can also be used for forwarding, where an
      IPv4 destination address and optionally a destination port is mapped
      into an IPv6 address or prefix. Additional mapping rules are specified
      to allow for e.g. Multiple different IPv4 subnets to exist within the
      domain and optimize forwarding between them.</t>

      <t>Traffic outside of the domain (i.e. When the destination IPv4 address
      does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule IPv4 prefix in
      the Rules database) will be forward using the Default mapping rule. The
      Default mapping rule maps outside destinations to the BR's IPv6 address
      or prefix.</t>

      <t>In summary, there are three types of mapping rules: <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) - used for configuring the CE's IPv4
          address and/or port set assignment as well as deriving the MAP IPv6
          address that the CE is to use. There can only be one Basic Mapping
          Rule per End-user IPv6 prefix. The BMR is composed of the following
          parameters:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

              <t>Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

              <t>Rule EA-bits length (in bits)</t>

              <t>Rule Port Parameters (optional)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Forwarding Mapping Rule - used for forwarding in the MAP domain.
          The Basic Mapping Rule is also a Forwarding Mapping Rule. Each
          Forwarding Mapping Rule will result in an entry in the MRT for the
          Rule IPv4 prefix + any port range. The FMR consists of the following
          parameters: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

              <t>Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

              <t>Rule EA-bits length (in bits)</t>

              <t>Rule Port Parameters (optional)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Default Mapping Rule - used for destinations outside the MAP
          domain. An IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 entry is installed in the MRT for this
          rule. <list style="symbols">
              <t>IPv6 prefix of the BR</t>

              <t>Rule BR IPv4 address (Optional - can be used for testing a
              BR's reachability)</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A MAP node finds its Basic Mapping Rule by doing a longest match
      between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix in the Mapping
      Rule database. The rule is then used for IPv4 prefix, address or shared
      address assignment.</t>

      <t>A MAP IPv6 address is formed from the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix. This
      address MUST be recognized by the MAP node, typically a CE, and used to
      terminate all MAP traffic received by the node.</t>

      <t>Port-aware IPv4 entries in the MRT are installed for all the
      Forwarding Mapping Rules and an IPv4 default route for the Default
      Mapping Rule.</t>

      <t>In hub and spoke mode, all traffic MUST be forwarded using the
      Default Mapping Rule.</t>

      <section title="Basic mapping rule (BMR)">
        <t>The BMR is used in combination with the CE's IPv6 prefix to derive
        the MAP IPv4 address, port-set and also the MAP IPv6 address. The
        structure of a MAP CE's IPv6 address is shown below, along with the
        Interface-identifer that is defined in <xref
        target="interface-id"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Rule IPv6 prefix is the part of the End-user IPv6 prefix (i.e.
        the regular IPv6 prefix or address that is assigned to any IPv6
        device), and is common among all CEs within a MAP domain. The Embedded
        Address bits (EA bits) are unique per end user within that Rule IPv6
        prefix. Some readers likel to think of these as "MAP customer
        identifier bits" in a given MAP domain that is scoped by the Rule IPv6
        prefix. When present, the EA bits encode a full or partial IPv4
        address and, in the shared IPv4 address case, a Port-Set Identifier
        (PSID) that determines the allowed port-range for the MAP CE. An
        EA-bit length of 0 signifies that all relevant MAP IPv4 addressing
        information is passed directly in the BMR rule, and not derived from
        the End-user IPv6 prefix.</t>

        <t>The MAP subnet ID is defined to be the first subnet (all bits set
        to zero) of length s required to make n+o+s=64. A MAP CE node MUST
        reserve the first IPv6 prefix in a End-user IPv6 prefix for the
        purpose of MAP.</t>

        <t>CE's MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the End-user IPv6
        prefix with the all zeros MAP subnet-id and the interface-id as
        specified in <xref target="interface-id"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The CE's IPv4 address is synthesized from the CE's IPv6 address and
        the parameters obtained in the BMR, namely by extracting the IPv4
        suffix from the EA-bits, if any, and combining it with the Rule's IPv4
        prefix. Figures below show the synthesis for cases of a Shared IPv4
        address, and a non-shared, complete, IPv4 address:</t>

        <t>The length of r MAY be zero, in which case the complete IPv4
        address or prefix is encoded in the EA bits. If only a part of the
        IPv4 address/prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the Rule IPv4 prefix is
        provisioned to the CE by other means (e.g. a DHCPv6 option). To create
        a complete IPv4 address (or prefix), the IPv4 address suffix (p) from
        the EA bits, are concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r bits).</t>

        <t>The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is equal to the
        BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length. The length of the EA bits field (o) is
        given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length, and can be between 0 and 48. The
        sum of the Rule IPv6 Prefix length and the Rule EA-bits length MUST be
        less or equal than the End-user IPv6 prefix length.</t>

        <t>If o + r &lt; 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then an IPv4
        prefix is assigned.</t>

        <t>If o + r is equal to 32, then a full IPv4 address is to be
        assigned. The address is created by concatenating the Rule IPv4 prefix
        and the EA-bits.</t>

        <t>If o + r is &gt; 32, then a shared IPv4 address is to be assigned.
        The number of IPv4 address suffix bits (p) in the EA bits is given by
        32 - r bits. The PSID bits are used to create a port-set. The length
        of the PSID bit field within EA bits is: o - p.</t>

        <t>The length of r MAY be 32, with no part of the IPv4 address
        embedded in the EA bits. This results in a mapping with no dependence
        between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address. In addition the length
        of o MAY be zero (no EA bits embedded in the End-User IPv6 prefix),
        meaning that also the PSID is provisioned using e.g. The DHCP
        option.</t>

        <t>In the following examples, only the suffix (last 8 bits) of the
        IPv4 address is embedded in the EA bits (r = 24), while the IPv4
        prefix (first 24 bits) is given in the BMR Rule IPv4 prefix.</t>

      <section title="Port mapping algorithm">
        <t>The Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) is used in MAP domains
        whose rules allow IPv4 address sharing. Each CE in such a domain has
        an IPv4 address and a unique Port-Set Identifier (PSID), that is
        derived by means of the BMR. For a given IPv4 address, the algorithm
        allows each PSID to be processed to reveal a set of unique
        non-overlapping ports, or alternatively for any given port to derive
        the PSID it corresponds to. Two extreme cases supported by algorithm
        are: (1) the port numbers are not contiguous for each PSID, but
        uniformly distributed across the port range (0-65535); (2) the port
        numbers are contiguous in a single range for each PSID.</t>

        <section title="GMA Excluded Ports">
          <t>By default the GMA ensures that a number of "well known" ports
          are excluded from use by the algorithm. This number is determined by
          the number of offset bits (a), in the figure above. This value can
          be optionally provisioned via the "Rule Port Mapping Parameters" in
          the Basic Mapping Rule. In the absence of such provisioning, the
          defaults are: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Excluded ports : 0-4095</t>

              <t>Offset bits (a) : 4</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>For (a) offset bits, the range of excluded ports is 0 to 2 ^
          (16-a) - 1.</t>

    <section title="Packet Forwarding">
      <t>The mapping rules and architectual building blocks are combined at
      the CE and BR to enable IPv4-IPv6 communication as follows.</t>

      <section title="IPv4 to IPv6 at the CE">
        <t>A MAP-T CE receiving IPv4 packets SHOULD perform NAT44 function
        first and create appropriate NAT44 stateful bindings. The resulting
        IPv4 packets MUST contain the source IPv4 address and source transport
        port number assigned to the CE by means of the MAP Basic Mapping Rule
        (BMR).</t>

        <t>The IPv4 traffic is subject to a longest IPv4 address + port match
        MAP rule selection using the MRT, which then determines the subsequent
        NAT64 operation. By default, all traffic is matched to default mapping
        rule (DMR), and subject to the stateless NAT64 operation using the DMR
        parameters for the MAP algorithm and NAT64.</t>

        <t>An optional mapping rule, known as a forward mapping rule (FMR),
        can be used when forwarding to destinations that correspond to a
        specific IPv4+port range in the MAP-T domain i.e. Typically the IPv4
        address and port range of another MAP-T CE, aka mesh-mode. Traffic
        that is matched to such a rule is subject to the stateless NAT64
        operation using the FMR parameters for the MAP algorithm and stateless
        NAT64.</t>

        <t>A MAP-T CE MUST support a default mapping rule and SHOULD support
        one or more forward mapping rules.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 to IPv4 at the CE">
        <t>A MAP-T CE receiving an IPv6 packet performs its regular IPv6
        operations, whereby only packets that are addressed to the MAP-T BMR
        addresses are forwarded to the CE&rsquo;s stateless NAT64 function.
        All other IPv6 traffic SHOULD be forwarded as per the CE&rsquo;s IPv6
        routing rules. The CE SHOULD check that MAP-T received packets'
        transport-layer destination port number is in the range configured by
        MAP for the CE and the CE SHOULD drop any non conforming packet and
        respond with an ICMPv6 "Address Unreachable" (Type 1, Code 3).</t>

        <t>The CE's stateless NAT64 function MUST derive the IPv4 source and
        destination addresses as per Section 5 of this document and MUST
        replace the IPv6 header with an IPv4 header in accordance with <xref
        target="RFC6145"></xref>. The resulting IPv4 packet is then forwarded
        to the CE&rsquo;s NAPT function, when this is enabled, where the
        destination IPv4 address and port number MUST be mapped to their
        original value, before being forwarded according to the CE's regular
        IPv4 rules. When the NAPT function is not enabled, the traffic from
        the stateless NAT64 function is directly forwarded according to the
        CE's IPv4 rules.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 to IPv4 at the BR">
        <t>A MAP-T BR receiving IPv6 packets MUST select a best matching MAP
        rule based on a longest address match of the packets' source address
        against the BR&rsquo;s configured MAP BMR prefix(es), as well as a
        match of the packet destination address against the configured FMR
        prefix(es). The selected MAP rule allows the BR to determine the CE's
        range from the port-set-id contained in the source IPv6 address. The
        BR MUST perform a validation of the consistency of the source against
        the allowed values from the identified port-range port. If the packets
        source port number is found to be outside the range allowed for this
        CE-index and the BMR, the BR MUST drop the packet and respond with an
        ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable, Source address failed ingress/egress
        policy" (Type 1, Code 5).</t>

        <t>The BR MUST derive the source and destination IPv4 addresses as per
        Section 5 of this document and translate the IPv6 to IPv4 headers
        following <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>. The resulting IPv4 packets
        are then passed to regular IPv4 forwarding by the BR.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv4 to IPv6 at the BR">
        <t>A MAP-T BR receiving IPv4 packets uses a longest match IPv4 + port
        lookup to select the target MAP-T domain and rule. The BR MUST then
        derive the IPv6 source and destination addresses from the IPv4 source
        and destination address and port as per Section 5 of this document.
        Following this, the BR MUST translate the IPv4 to IPv6 headers
        following <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>. The resulting IPv6 packets
        are then passed to regular IPv6 forwarding.</t>

        <t>Note that the operation of a BR when forwarding to MAP-T domains
        that do not utilize IPv4 address sharing, is the same as stateless
        IPv4/IPv6 translation.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="ICMP Handling">
      <t>ICMP messages need to be supported in MAP-T domain and also across
      it, taking into consideration also the NAPT component and best current
      practice documented in <xref target="RFC5508"></xref> along with some
      additional specific considerations.</t>

      <t>MAP-T CEs and BRs MUST follow ICMP/ICMPv6 translation as per <xref
      target="RFC6145"></xref>, with the following extension to cover the
      address sharing/port-range feature.</t>

      <t>Unlike TCP and UDP, which each provide two port fields to represent
      both source and destination, the ICMP/ICMPv6 <xref
      target="RFC0792"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4443"></xref> Query message
      header has only one ID field which needs to be used to identify a
      sending IPv4 host.</t>

      <t>When receiving IPv4 ICMP messages, the MAP-T CE SHOULD rewrite the ID
      field to a port value derived from the Port-set-id. A BR MUST translate
      the resulting ICMPv6 packets back to ICMP preserving the ID field on its
      way to an IPv4 destination.</t>

      <t>In the return path, when MAP-T BR receives an ICMP packet containing
      an ID field which is bound for a shared address in the MAP-T domain, the
      MAP-T BR SHOULD use the ID value as a substitute for the destination
      port in determining the IPv6 destination address. In all other cases,
      the MAP-T BR MUST derive the destination IPv6 address by simply mapping
      the destination IPv4 address without additional port info.</t>

      <t>If a MAP BR receives an ICMP error message on its IPv4 interface, the
      MAP BR should translate the ICMP message to an appropriate ICMPv6
      message, as per [RFC6145] and forward it to the intended MAP CE with the
      following considerations. If IPv4 address is not shared, the MAP BR
      generates a CE IPv6 address from the IPv4 destination address in the
      ICMP error message and encapsulates the ICMP message in IPv6. If the
      IPv4 address is shared, the MAP BR derives an original IPv4 packet from
      the ICMP payload and generates a CE IPv6 address from the source address
      and the source port in the original IPv4 packet.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery">
      <t>Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, handling the
      maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
      connecting the two address families. There are three mechanisms to
      handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
      transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
      option <xref target="RFC0897"></xref>. MAP uses all three mechanisms to
      deal with different cases.</t>

      <section title="Fragmentation in the MAP domain">
        <t>Translating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP domain will
        increase its size by 20 bytes respectively. It is strongly recommended
        that the MTU in the MAP domain is well managed and that the IPv6 MTU
        on the CE WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs
        within the boundary of the MAP domain.</t>

        <t>Fragmentation in MAP-T domain is to be handled as described in
        section 4 and 5 of <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders">
        <t>Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of the MAP
        domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the transport
        protocol destination port. The transport protocol information is only
        available in the first fragment received. As described in section
        5.3.3 of <xref target="RFC6346"></xref> a MAP node receiving an IPv4
        fragmented packet from outside has to reassemble the packet before
        sending the packet onto the MAP link. If the first packet received
        contains the transport protocol information, it is possible to
        optimize this behavior by using a cache and forwarding the fragments
        unchanged. A description of this algorithm is outside the scope of
        this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside">
        <t>If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same IPv4
        address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host outside the
        domain. Those hosts may use the same IPv4 fragmentation identifier,
        resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination
        host. Given that the IPv4 fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit field,
        it could be used similarly to port ranges. A MAP CE SHOULD rewrite the
        IPv4 fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated port set.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Usage Considerations">
      <section title="Hub and spoke with per subscriber rules">
        <t>Existing IPv4 service can be realized with MAP using a mapping rule
        per subscriber. By embedding no part of the IPv4 address in the IPv6
        prefix, no dependency between the two address families is created.
        This may be useful in cases where the IPv6 address allocation is
        sparse, or for other reasons it is difficult to create efficient
        mapping rules.</t>

        <t>The operator has to the choice of provisioning a full IPv4 address
        to the end-user, or a shared IPv4 address by also provisioning the
        PSID in the DHCPv6 option. A hybrid of this use case is to provision
        the full IPv4 address in the DHCPv6 option, while embedding the PSID
        in the IPv6 prefix. That will result in one mapping rule per IPv4
        address, e.g. With a sharing ratio of 64, one rule per 64
        customers.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Communication with IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain">
        <t>MAP-T allows communication between both IPv4-only and any IPv6
        enabled end hosts, with native IPv6-only servers which are using
        IPv4-mapped IPv6 address based on DMR in the MAP-T domain. In this
        mode, the IPv6-only servers SHOULD have both A and AAAA records in DNS
        <xref target="RFC6219"></xref>. DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref>
        become required only when IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain are
        expected themselves to initiate communication to external IPv4-only
        hosts.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Backwards compatibility">
        <t>A MAP-T CE, in all configuration modes, is by default compatible
        with regular [RFC6146] stateful NAT64 devices that are configured to
        use/advertise BR prefixes. This allows the use of MAP-T CEs in
        environments that require statistical multiplexing of IPv4 addresses
        while being able to compromise on the stateful nature. Furthermore, a
        MAP-T CE configured to operate without address sharing (no PSID) is
        compatible with any stateless NAT64 [RFC6146] devices positioned as
        BRs.</t>

          <t hangText="Spoofing attacks:">With consistency checks between IPv4
          and IPv6 sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by
          MAP nodes, MAP does not introduce any new opportunity for spoofing
          attacks that would not already exist in IPv6.</t>

          <t hangText="Denial-of-service attacks:">In MAP domains where IPv4
          addresses are shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram reassembly may be
          necessary introduces an opportunity for DOS attacks. This is
          inherent to address sharing, and is common with other address
          sharing approaches such as DS-Lite and NAT64/DNS64. The best
          protection against such attacks is to accelerate IPv6 enablement in
          both clients and servers so that, where MAP is supported, it is less
          and less used.</t>

          <t hangText="Routing-loop attacks:">This attack may exist in some
          automatic tunneling scenarios are documented in <xref

          BRs checks that the IPv6 source address of a received IPv6 packet is
          a CE address based on Forwarding Mapping Rule.</t>

          (<xref target="RFC4953"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5961"></xref>,
          <xref target="RFC6056"></xref>. The attacks depend on guessing which
          ports are currently used by target hosts, and using an unrestricted
          port set is preferable, i.e. Using native IPv6 connections that are
          not subject to MAP port range restrictions. To minimize this type of
          attacks when using a restricted port set, the MAP CE's NAT44
          filtering behavior SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering".
          Furthermore, the MAP CEs SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy function
          to handle DNS traffic, and source such traffic from IPv6 interfaces
          not assigned to MAP-T. Practicalities of these methods are discussed

   Given the MAP domain information and an IPv6 address of
   an endpoint:

   IPv6 prefix assigned to the end user:  2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
   Basic Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
      192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix), 16 (Rule EA-bits length)}
   Sharing ratio:  256 (16 - (32 - 24) = 8. 2^8 = 256)

   IPv4 source port:  80
   IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
   IPv4 destination port:  9030

   Configured Forwarding Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40
      (Rule IPv6 prefix), 192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
      16 (Rule EA-bits length)}

   MAP-T BR Prefix  2001:db8:ffff::/64

   The above information allows the BR to derive as follows
   the mapped destination IPv6 address for the corresponding
   MAP-T CE, and also the mapped source IPv6 address for
   the IPv4 source.

   IPv4 suffix bits (p)  32 - 24 = 8 (18 (0x12))
   PSID length:  8
   PSID:  0x34 (9030 (0x2346))

   The resulting IPv6 packet will have the following key fields:

   IPv6 source address  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::
   IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400
   IPv6 source Port:  80
   IPv6 destination Port:  9030

   An IPv4 host behind the MAP-T CE (addressed as per the previous
   examples) corresponding with IPv4 host 1.2.3.4 will have its
   packets converted into IPv6 using the DMR configured on the MAP-T
   CE as follows:

   Default Mapping Rule used by MAP-T CE:  {2001:db8:ffff::/64
   (Rule IPv6 prefix), 0.0.0.0/0 (Rule IPv4 prefix), null (BR IPv4
      address)}

   IPv4 source address (post NAT44 if present)  192.0.2.18
   IPv4 destination address:  1.2.3.4
   IPv4 source port (post NAT44 if present):  9030
   IPv4 destination port:  80
   IPv6 source address of MAP-T CE:
                        2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400
